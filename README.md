# huenix

## Purpose

I've never written shell before, so this project's purpose is to learn it. That aside, the function of this repo is to use shortcuts in terminal to make quick changes to my hue lights such as turning them on and off quickly or setting pre-defined scenes.

## Current Usage (Unfinished, currently **not** functional)

Run `./huenix.sh` in terminal. Current limitation is that you must be in the /huenix directory. You'll then be asked to enter an ON or OFF value and then brightness as a percentage. These arguements are then passed into `lights.py` for the main program.
